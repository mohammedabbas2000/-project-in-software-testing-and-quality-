# Final project in the software testing and quality course
idea:
The work is designed to test your knowledge of the topics studied during the semester. During the project you will be required to develop software
medical that will identify the patient's problem/disease and offer appropriate treatment. The purpose of the software is to offer the treatment
The most suitable for the patient! A task file (pdf \ word) will be attached to the project, in which the tests you performed will be described.
Remarks:
You can develop the software in any language you want (that will allow you to perform tests).
The software that will be developed should be graphical (have a graphical user interface) so that it is possible to perform GUI tests. Not a screen
Black with prints ... a little color won't hurt..
Software requirements:
The software should meet at least the following basic requirements:
 An opening screen where the doctor identifies himself to enter the system.
o Identification is carried out through:
 Username - contains between 6 and 8 characters. Of the characters, at most 2 digits and all the rest letters
)English(.
 Password - between 8 and 10 characters. Contains at least one letter, one digit and one special character (!, #, $, etc.).
 Number 17.
o An error in one of the details should lead to the display of an appropriate error message.
 Possibility to enter the patient's details and his medical condition - you have to think for yourself what the necessary fields are.
 A button that will display the medical diagnosis and the recommended treatment.
 All the details of the patient's visit to the doctor will be saved in a text file. (patient details, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment)
 The system will be able to ask the patient questions (the answer to which is yes / no) if necessary and will consider the answer
During the diagnosis (for example, do you smoke?). The list of questions will be predefined in the software and there is no need to allow
Adding more questions
